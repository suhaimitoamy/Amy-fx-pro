# Bug History

## Trading Practice horizontal zoom failed and drawings drifted from chart scale
- **Date:** 2026-08-17
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Select/Edit gave the full SVG overlay pointer ownership, blocking blank-chart gestures. Drawing redraws listened only to visible time-range changes, which can remain unchanged when clamped edges keep the same timestamps while logical bar spacing changes; price-scale gestures also had no redraw signal.
- **Fix:** Explicitly enabled Lightweight Charts pinch and time-axis scaling, passed blank Select/Edit space through to the chart while retaining painted-object/handle hit targets, subscribed to logical-range and pane-size changes, and coalesced wheel/pointer/touch redraws from persistent TIME + PRICE anchors.
- **Validation:** Eight focused chart tests prove horizontal and vertical coordinate synchronization, immutable drawing anchors, native gesture configuration, and drawing-only pointer ownership. All 119 application regression files pass locally.
- **Release:** Resolved in active signed release `2.0.0-pro.326` / `950326`; Android CI, identity, signer continuity, release asset, checksum, and published endpoint verification all pass.

## Trading Practice drawings ignored touch and text editor could be clipped
- **Date:** 2026-08-17
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Saving a drawing immediately called `setTool(null)`, disabling pointer events on the SVG overlay. Selection then depended on narrow geometric tolerances, while the annotation form was absolutely positioned inside an overflow-clipped chart shell.
- **Fix:** Finished drawings now switch directly to Select/Edit with the new object selected; rendered SVG ownership, 28px invisible line/path hit strokes, and 36px handle targets make mobile selection and dragging reliable. Text/Note/Price Note use a fixed dialog attached outside the chart shell.
- **Validation:** Seven focused chart tests cover automatic selection, painted-target selection, TIME + PRICE drag persistence, visible text submission, touch target sizing, and render/select behavior for every supported tool. All 119 application regression files pass locally.
- **Release:** First resolved in signed `.325`; current active `.326` preserves the repair and passes the same identity, signer, asset, checksum, and endpoint gates.

## Trading Practice scale, decision persistence, and Live continuity
- **Date:** 2026-08-17
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** The right scale had no minimum width/whole-label guarantee inside an overflow-clipped shell; Live replaced the selected pack with a separate native buffer; IndexedDB writes reported success before transaction commit; and the legacy drawing layer supported only three primitives without selection/editing.
- **Fix:** Reserved an 84–92px responsive price axis and kept overlays inside the plot, merged the immutable selected pack into Live with ordered timestamp upsert/deduplication, verified decision retrieval only after commit, and added a persistent editable TIME + PRICE drawing model.
- **Release:** Resolved in active signed release `2.0.0-pro.324` / `950324` after full CI identity, signer, asset, checksum, and endpoint verification.

## Fixed Competing Mapping Authorities and Live Recompute Paths — 2026-08-11

### Legacy Router and UI Layers Could Reinterpret or Replace Direction
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** The old pipeline combined validated-context evaluation, regime/strategy routing, cross-timeframe voting, UI reconciliation, Entry Watch mutation, and Scalper bridges. Several layers could derive or rewrite directional fields after the core analysis, leaving more than one effective Mapping authority.
- **Fix:** `Amy-SMC-D` replay now produces the canonical immutable Mapping contract. Router compatibility is explicitly execution-consumer-only, Mapping Snapshot projects D fields, and Entry/Scalper/zone/UI adapters cannot overwrite D direction.

### Mapping Could Be Coupled to Live Price or Recurring Render Work
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** Legacy reconciliation and runtime timers listened to live market events or polled frequently, allowing price-facing updates to republish Mapping state and rebuild the view even without a new closed candle.
- **Fix:** Twelve Data WebSocket ticks now update targeted price/status elements only. Mapping replay runs only from the REST closed-candle analysis path; Mapping UI and adapter refreshes are event-driven and keyed by the closed source candle.

### Stale Provider State Could Hide a Valid Last Mapping
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Freshness/integrity layers could clear or replace the full Mapping when REST refresh failed, even though a previously analyzed closed candle remained valid.
- **Fix:** Freshness remains an internal quality signal, while the last valid D result and its source timestamp remain visible until a newer valid closed candle is available.

### H1 Dealing Range Could Admit the Current Candle or the Wrong Source
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** The previous engine did not implement the finalized D H1 previous-240 contract as the sole H1 range source, and generic location/context logic risked contaminating the descriptive field.
- **Fix:** H1 range is calculated from exactly the prior 240 normalized closed H1 candles; current H1 is excluded. M5/M15 keep their structural sources, and all three pure-location outputs are dependency-isolated from predictors.

## Fixed Preview Duplicate News Delivery — 2026-08-01

### One News Event Could Produce Two or Three Notifications
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Preview devices received the data-only push from `news-sync`, the second system notification from `news-system-push`, and could also receive the local WorkManager fallback for the same news item.
- **Fix:** Preview devices now use one dedicated system-notification route. A canonical event key, atomic delivery ledger, retry state, and scheduler lease enforce one successful delivery per event/device; the upstream legacy data route excludes Preview so the unchanged public system route receives no Preview pairs, and Preview cancels its old local fallback.
- **Validation:** Source regression covers routing, ledger/RPC markers, Preview device isolation, and local fallback cancellation; deployed health and database state must be checked before release.

## Fixed Pattern-v3 TP1 UI Refresh — 2026-08-01

### TP1 Could Be Reached Without Refreshing the Active Card
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Pattern-v3 deliberately keeps lifecycle status `ACTIVE` after TP1 because Stop Loss does not move to breakeven, while the Mapping render signature did not include `tp1Hit` or lifecycle sequence.
- **Fix:** Scalper payload and execution-authority signatures now include TP1 progress and pattern metadata, so the UI immediately changes to `TP1 HIT · SL TETAP` without changing the lifecycle status.
- **Validation:** Deterministic regression verifies that otherwise-identical ACTIVE payloads produce different signatures when TP1 progress changes.

## Fixed Private Preview Frozen Live Price — 2026-07-31

### XAU/USD Price Stopped Refreshing Automatically
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** Preview 293/294 had replaced the intended Twelve Data WebSocket quote stream with a 20-second REST request to the shared Mapping proxy. The display therefore depended on REST freshness/cache and consumed daily API credits while the account showed no WebSocket connection.
- **Fix:** Preview 295 restores one native Android WebSocket subscription for XAU/USD, validates provider timestamps, and reconnects after network, foreground, socket, or stalled-tick failures. The key remains outside WebView storage. Mapping candles retain their existing REST/Vercel path unchanged.
- **Validation:** JavaScript syntax checks, focused live-price/security/Preview identity tests, and all 92 JavaScript regression files passed. Android compile, lint, signing, and APK identity remain mandatory release-workflow gates.

## Fixed Preview Mapping Stability and Scalper Shadow Defects — 2026-07-30

### Mapping Root Render Flicker and Scroll Jumps
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Ordinary refresh paths repeatedly assigned the complete `#app` markup, republished unchanged Mapping snapshots, and let presentation observers move panels after the canonical renderer had placed them.
- **Fix:** Mapping now skips equal state signatures, patches keyed DOM nodes in place, preserves disclosure state by stable key, aborts superseded analysis requests, and keeps Dashboard/Analyze source order identical to observer order. Background refresh does not force scroll.

### Scalper Shadow Panel Disappeared During Refresh
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** The panel was created only by the polling runtime, while a later Mapping root render removed it; each response then replaced the panel with `outerHTML`.
- **Fix:** Dashboard and Analyze own one permanent keyed shell. Polling patches only its content, keeps the last valid payload through transient failures, and rejects late or lifecycle-regressive state for the same setup ID.

### Mapping Header Leaked Status Text and a Second Dot
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Cause:** Connection, clock, consistency, and integrity runtimes all wrote different strings into `#conn`; the generic online pseudo-element rendered an additional dot.
- **Fix:** Every Mapping header writer restores exactly `●`; freshness is represented by color/data attributes. The 18×18 container is fixed, pseudo-elements are disabled, and obsolete top-header time fields are empty and hidden.

### Scalper Shadow Stop Evaluated Before a Causal Entry
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** A historical candle could be selected as “next open,” activation and stop evaluation could occur in one engine run, and an IFVG stop reference could sit on the wrong side of entry with only a minimal ATR buffer.
- **Fix:** Entry starts at the first live open after detection, is persisted with an entry lock before lifecycle evaluation, and ignores closed-candle highs/lows before the entry timestamp. Stops use the setup candle’s closed M15 structural invalidation wick/zone plus a 0.20 ATR buffer; wrong-side structural references invalidate instead of being rescued by the buffer. Optimistic status/timestamp writes prevent late runs from reversing newer lifecycle state.
- **Validation:** Deterministic fixtures and regression tests only; no backtest was run.

## Fixed Causal Entry Watch Replay Defects — 2026-07-29

### Terminal Setup State Was Dropped
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Consumers projected only `activeSetup`, so a terminal authoritative `entryMap.setup` disappeared before setup execution, Entry Watch, scanner, and notification handling.
- **Fix:** Added a shared lifecycle contract and preserved the authoritative setup through every consumer without changing lifecycle formulas or evaluation order.

### Replay Session Used Wall Clock
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Core Mapping analysis called `Date.now()` directly, so historical replay could display current session context. This affected Mapping Engine replay, not only the external audit harness.
- **Fix:** Live mode still uses the wall clock; replay accepts an explicit timestamp or the last closed candle timestamp and ignores an open future candle.

### Pre-Forecast Sweep Entered Causal Sequence
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** Sweep memory did not require the selected sweep to occur after Direction Forecast activation.
- **Fix:** Eligible sweep index must be at least forecast start; displaced MSS must remain later than the sweep and no later than the latest closed candle.

### Dealing Location Mixed Unpaired Swings and Breakout Close
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** The latest slow high and slow low could come from different legs, while MSS breakout close was used as the sole dealing-location reference. This made M5 fail every historical Dealing Location evaluation.
- **Fix:** Build a confirmed paired zigzag leg and gate on sweep position while recording POI, entry, and MSS close strength separately. Thresholds remain unchanged.

### Structural Target Diagnosis Hid Risk Rejection
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Cause:** A geometrically valid target could be labeled target-pass even when risk exceeded the unchanged 6 ATR cap.
- **Fix:** Diagnosis now reports `RISK > 6 ATR` separately from the four target-location outcomes.

## Fixed Mapping Accuracy V3 Defects — 2026-07-28

### Multiple Mapping State Writers
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** Entry Watch, integrity, and runtime repair layers could clear or replace `bestSetup`, `setups`, and result state after the concept engine finished.
- **Fix:** One causal engine owns the result and frozen Mapping snapshot; Entry Watch and repair layers are read-only/UI-only consumers.

### Mirrored H1 Bearish Forecast
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** A balanced compatibility fork re-enabled H1 bearish behavior that the trusted reference deliberately suppresses.
- **Fix:** The compatibility module delegates to the canonical forecast; H1 bearish always returns `NO CLEAR DIRECTION`.

### Weak Close-Cross Changed Structure
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Any close beyond a swing could be treated as BOS/MSS and flip the structure.
- **Fix:** Weak events remain `BREAK_CANDIDATE`; trend changes require 0.10 ATR penetration, 0.30 ATR body, and 0.45 body/range.

### Liquidity Self-Cancel and Reactivation
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** One interaction could be interpreted as both sweep and invalidation, and current-price evaluation could later reactivate it.
- **Fix:** First interaction is irreversible and classified as `CLOSED_THROUGH`, `SWEPT_UNCONFIRMED`, or `CONFIRMED_REACTION`.

### Premature Zone Inversion
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Wick mitigation or a single close could create IFVG/Breaker state.
- **Fix:** Conversion requires three outside closes, 0.30 ATR continuation, a later retest, and inverse rejection.

### Future Previous-Period Liquidity
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** Latest PDH/PDL/PWH/PWL used `availableIndex: 0`, allowing a historical trigger to see a level before its source period closed.
- **Fix:** Availability is the first candle at or after the source-period close.

### Entry Trigger Missed Trusted Trend Gates
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Cause:** The rebuilt sequence initially relied on Direction Forecast plus local structure without independently checking the trusted entry-time H4 bias, EMA21/34/90 stack, or H1 EMA-distance limit.
- **Fix:** Entry now requires point-in-time context close/EMA20 slope alignment, a directional local EMA stack, and the reference H1 maximum distance of 2.00 ATR. Context candles closing after the trigger are excluded.

### W1 Thursday Epoch Drift
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Generic Unix interval flooring anchored weekly closure to Thursday, which could lag or repeatedly refetch weekly candles.
- **Fix:** Server and client W1 closure boundaries use Monday 00:00 UTC.

### Terminal Entry Watch Kept Direction
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** A terminal scenario could keep a BUY/SELL watch action visible.
- **Fix:** SL hit, TP2 hit, TP1/BE, and expiry always render action `WAIT`.

### Stale WITA Soft-Render Selectors
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Cause:** Soft live rendering still queried old `top-wib`/`kz-wib` IDs.
- **Fix:** It now updates `top-wita` and `kz-wita` consistently.

## Fixed Market Context & Notification Defects — 2026-07-11

### Historical FVG ATR Contamination
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Every historical FVG was validated with the newest ATR regime.
- **Fix:** Each FVG now stores and uses ATR from immediately before it formed.

### Fixed-Price Liquidity Tolerance
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Equal highs/lows and level deduplication used hardcoded XAU distances regardless of volatility.
- **Fix:** Clustering, external classification, sweep penetration, and deduplication now scale with current ATR.

### Weak Order Block Origin
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** The last opposite candle could be labeled an OB even without a valid displaced break.
- **Fix:** OB creation now requires a valid displaced break and records whether the impulse created imbalance.

### News Notification Opened Generic Page
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Notifications carried only the Market Intel page URL, not the Telegram post ID.
- **Fix:** Notifications now deep-link to `#news=<post-id>`; Market Intel opens the News tab, expands the item, and scrolls it into view.

### Newest News Missing
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** The API sliced Telegram HTML order before sorting, while item timestamps could be empty or approximate.
- **Fix:** Posts are sorted by numeric Telegram ID before filtering/slicing and refreshed with a minute cache key.

## Fixed Mapping Logic Defects — 2026-07-11

### Historical Liquidity Reactivation
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Mapping classified liquidity from current price only, allowing previously swept levels to become active again after price returned.
- **Fix:** BSL/SSL and EQH/EQL now scan every closed candle after their origin index and preserve `SWEPT` state.

### Historical ATR Regime Contamination
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** All historical structure breaks used the latest 14-candle ATR.
- **Fix:** Each breakout now uses ATR calculated only from candles preceding that breakout.

### Loose Sweep and RR Validation
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** The primary sweep model did not require a close back inside the level, and RR below 1:2 could survive filtering.
- **Fix:** Sweep requires wick penetration plus reclaim close; RR below 2.0 is a fatal conflict.

### HTF Location-Only Bias
- **Severity:** High
- **Cause:** Discount automatically implied bullish and Premium automatically implied bearish.
- **Fix:** Confirmed HTF structure determines direction; Premium/Discount now measures alignment and entry quality.

### Unreachable Silver Bullet Window
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Cause:** New York Killzone matched before its nested Silver Bullet window.
- **Fix:** Silver Bullet is evaluated first.

## Fixed Bugs

### Mapping Closed-Candle Contamination
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** High — the latest TwelveData candle was treated as closed during Mapping analysis.
- **Fix:** Mapping candle loading now excludes the newest still-forming REST candle from the analysis set.

### Target Expiry Documentation Mismatch
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — Mapping and native scanner used a 4-hour expiry while project QA specified 24 hours.
- **Fix:** Both JS live-state filtering and native scanner expiry now use 24 hours.

### Mapping Conflict Confidence Penalty
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — confidence checked the final bias text for `CONFLICT`, although conflicts belong to the setup object.
- **Fix:** Decision confidence now reads the setup conflict level.

### TwelveData Error Masking
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — provider HTTP/status errors were converted into empty successful responses.
- **Fix:** TwelveData proxy, Heatmap, Liquidity, and News endpoints now expose provider failures with error HTTP statuses.

### Mapping Analysis UI Density
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — Analyze rendered every diagnostic section expanded at once.
- **Fix:** Secondary Mapping sections are now collapsible; the Decision card and Valid Break section remain visible first.

### Academy Admin Auth Stub
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** High — Academy access functions always returned success.
- **Fix:** Added a device-local first-use access code with SHA-256 storage and session-based access.

### Mapping Automatic Notification Collision
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** High — WebView setup notifications could duplicate or conflict with native scanner alerts.
- **Cause:** `runAnalysis()` called `notifyImportant()` after each analysis result.
- **Fix:** Removed the automatic `notifyImportant()` call. Native `ScannerService` remains the only automatic target-alert owner; manual test notification remains available.

### Candle Cache Retention Unit Mismatch
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** High — candle cleanup compared Unix seconds with Unix milliseconds.
- **Cause:** candle `open_time` values are stored in seconds, while `cleanupExpiredCandles()` used a millisecond cutoff.
- **Fix:** Retention cutoff now uses Unix seconds.

### Android Market Intel Asset Drift
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — APK assets had only News and Heatmap while repo source had Liquidity.
- **Cause:** `apps/market-intel/` and `app/src/main/assets/apps/market-intel/` were different versions.
- **Fix:** Synchronized the repo source version into the Android WebView assets.

### Missing Kotlin Mapping Core
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** Medium — unit tests referenced `MappingLogicCore` without a production source file.
- **Fix:** Restored `MappingLogicCore.kt` from the repository backup so the test source has its required class.

### Admin Academy Failed to Load
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Severity:** High — page completely fails to open
- **Cause:** `apps/academy/index.html` used folder-only link:
  ```html
  <a href="admin/">Admin</a>
  ```
  Android WebView with `file:///android_asset/...` does not auto-resolve folders to `index.html`, causing the page to fail and redirect to `error.html`.
- **Fix:** Use explicit path:
  ```html
  <a href="admin/index.html">Admin</a>
  ```
- **File changed:** `app/src/main/assets/apps/academy/index.html`
- **Note:** Do NOT modify `MainActivity.kt` for this issue.

## Known Issues (Not Fixed Yet)

### auth.js Is Still a Stub
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known issue, not fixed
- **File:** `app/src/main/assets/apps/academy/assets/js/auth.js`
- **Problem:** `requireLogin()` always returns true, `validateCode()` always returns `{ok: true}`. Admin panel is not actually protected — anyone can access and edit Academy content.
- **Risk:** Low if app is private, High if app goes public.
- **Proposed fix:** Add SHA-256 passcode validation (see implementation plan).

### API_BASE Hardcoded
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known issue, not fixed
- **File:** `apps/market-intel/app.js` (line 9)
- **Problem:** `API_BASE = 'https://amy-fx.vercel.app/api'` — if domain changes, frontend will still hit old domain.
- **Risk:** Medium — breaks if Vercel deployment moves to a different domain.
- **Proposed fix:** Detect WebView (`file://` protocol) and fallback to hardcoded, otherwise use relative `/api`.

### TwelveData Error Response Not Handled
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known issue, not fixed
- **Files:** `api/heatmap.js`, `api/twelvedata.js`, `api/liquidity.js`
- **Problem:** TwelveData can return HTTP 200 with `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}` (e.g., rate limit). Code currently ignores this and returns empty data silently.
- **Risk:** Low — fails silently, user sees "no data" without explanation.
- **Proposed fix:** Add `if (data.status === 'error') throw new Error(data.message)` after `res.json()`.

### Telegram Scraping Regex May Break
- **Status:** ⚠️ Known issue, not fixed
- **File:** `api/news.js` — `extractPosts()` function
- **Problem:** Regex depends on exact Telegram HTML class names (`tgme_widget_message_text`, etc.). If Telegram changes their web view markup, scraping silently returns empty.
- **Risk:** Medium — no monitoring or alert when this happens.
- **Note:** Do NOT change `extractPosts()` regex unless it actually breaks. Adding diagnostic info is safer.

## GitHub Actions Academy Vault Checkout Failure — 2026-07-11

- **Severity:** High — APK build stopped before Gradle ran.
- **Cause:** Both APK workflows tried to checkout the private `amy-trading-academy-vault` repository during every build, although the generated Academy assets were already committed in Amy-fx. The missing cross-repository token caused `Input required and not supplied: token`.
- **Fix:** Removed the private Vault checkout and runtime Academy generator steps from `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` and `.github/workflows/build-debug.yml`. APK builds now use the committed Academy assets directly.
- **Verification:** GitHub Actions `Build Amy FX APK` run 29158586991 completed successfully.

## 2026-09-05 — Jalur 03 Replay Entry Save

- Fixed Candle Replay submit accessing `event.currentTarget` after awaiting storage. Browser event dispatch clears this property, causing entry saving and the final button reset to fail.
- Capture the form synchronously and retain it through save, duplicate-decision handling, and error recovery.
- Validation: 24 Trading Practice tests pass, including new, already-locked, and failed-storage submits with a cleared event target; JavaScript syntax and diff whitespace checks pass.


## 2026-09-05 — Pro328

Pro328: isolated per-device scan/recommendation/notification paths; enabled drivers skipped before detectors. Discipline retest cannot fill historical candles before setup creation and resolves same-bar SL/TP conservatively. Drawing drag final pointer position and cancellation preserve persisted objects. Focused engine/drawing/API regression checks passed (50 checks). Full local suite stopped at missing files in partial checkout; CI performs the complete suite. No profitability backtest added or thresholds tuned.
